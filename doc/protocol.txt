HEDEEP PROTOCOL

Introduction:
In the below, angle brackets ('<' and '>') surround a variable, and curly 
braces ('{' and '}') surround a tuple. Commas (',') separate values. The first
column is the message, and the second column is the description of the message.

The first section, 'Nodes', describes those messages that must be handled by 
nodes. The second section, 'Server', describes those messages handled by the 
server, supplied as 'serve.erl' in this distribution.


Nodes:

{ map, <token>}			Maps the function on token, and when finished, 
				sends { collect, { <token>, <evaluation> } } to
				the server*.
{ reduce, {<key>, <value>}}	Performs the reduce function on the key value 
				pair*.

*All nodes will be asked to perform the mapping operation. Only the first node 
in the list of nodes passed to serve/2 will be asked to reduce, and will be 
the accumulator. 



Server:

{serve, <data>}			Call serve/2 with the original list of nodes 
				and the new data
{serve, <nodes>, <data>}	Call serve/2 with the supplied nodes and data
{collect, {<key>, <value>}}	This should be sent by the mapper, and upon 
				reception sends a reduce message to the reducer
